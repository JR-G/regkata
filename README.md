# regkata

> Master regular expressions through practice, one kata at a time.

An interactive CLI tool that teaches you regex the way martial artists learn moves—through deliberate practice and progressive challenges. Inspired by vimtutor, regkata guides you from regex basics to advanced patterns with hands-on lessons.

## Why regkata?

Regular expressions are powerful but intimidating. Most tutorials throw syntax at you and hope it sticks. regkata takes a different approach: learn by doing. Each lesson presents a challenge, you write the regex, and get instant feedback. No copy-paste, no passive reading—just you and the pattern.
